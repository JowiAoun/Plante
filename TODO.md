# TODO

## Required
- [ ] Change the dark background to some kind of animated shadowed one perhaps, mobile compatible. Could also make it vary by themes (if implemented)
- [x] Add google auth (make sure to add production domain once deployed)
- [ ] Add push notifications
- [ ] Add spinning user image on levelup and animation in general (write story)
- [ ] Add "polling delay" type of thing for sensors data, i.e. for when we want to demo the project, we want to display that increasing some reading above its threshold will in fact send a warning to the phone and update on the website
- [ ] Add sound effects (i.e. notification, levelup, achievement, success toast, click [non invasive])
- [ ] When all pages are done, create different themes
- [ ] Use local storage to keep of settings or google account (more work)
- [ ] Wrap app in Docker (use dev mode)
- [ ] Create APIs
- [ ] Write API tests
- [ ] Create CI pipeline to run tests
- [ ] Create a beautiful README with the logo and images around. App must be easy to install, may require docker setup

## Optional
- [ ] Generate themes from settings page
- [ ] Change emojis around the pages to use pixelated versions instead
- [ ] Deploy storybook on vercel too
- [ ] Replace all mock data
- [ ] Add email notifications
